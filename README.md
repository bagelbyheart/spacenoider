# spacenoider

A pico-8 game by [@bagelbyheart](https://twitter.com/bagelbyheart) based roughly on arcade games like Galaga and Asteroids.

## Current Status

*Refactor Completed! (mostly!)*

Originally Spacenoider was just a change for me to play with "particle" systems in pico-8, but since then I've decided to see if I can work it into something a much more elaborate arcade type shmup. In my mind this will be divided between a few separate...

## Projects

Each of the projects below is something that I consider key to making a more thorough game out of Spacenoider.

- [ ] Intentionally designed levels  
  - [ ] Waves by time and by cleared enemies
  - [ ] Debris and neutral entities
  - [ ] More enemy sprites
- [ ] More elaborate power-ups  
  - [ ] Have levels
  - [ ] Modify player appearance
  - [ ] More fire types  
    - [ ] Use circle code to make angle shots
- [ ] Level bumpers  
  - [ ] Show current score and level
  - [ ] Move on after input

## Ugh Items

These are things that I would like to do, but seem overwhelming at the moment.

1. Unify all objects with drops. ie, there should be a drop version of everything that appears on screen that causes you to shoot that same object, which in turn means I need to encode the drop icon in the object.
